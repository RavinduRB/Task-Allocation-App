# Task Allocation App
## My First React App

Hello friends 😇👋. Today I teamed up with Llama Coder and Together AI 🚀 to create a “Task Allocation App”. This is my first React App. Due to the first app, there may be some small problems. But I think this is a good application.

Task Allocation App is a lightweight, easy-to-use task management app powered by React and Next.js. It is very convenient for small teams so that team members can easily assign and monitor tasks. With this app, you'll be able to create, update, and delete tasks while maintaining that each task is assigned to the correct team member.

🧐 Key Features:

**🔹Task management:**
Tasks can be easily added, edited, and deleted with details like title and description.

**🔹Accountability:**
This assigns a given task to a specific member selected from a drop-down selection menu so that everyone knows who is responsible for what.

**🔹Completion Tracking:**
Tasks can be marked as "complete" or reverted to "not complete" to track project completion.

**🔹Assignment Management:**
Team members can be dynamically added or removed to keep the list of potential assignees fresh.

It comes with a neat and intuitive interface that is best suited for small teams when it comes to organizing and streamlining workflow, thus making allocating and tracking tasks very easy and productive.
